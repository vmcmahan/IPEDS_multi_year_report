# IPEDS_multi_year_report
This code automates pulling multiple years of the same report from the IPEDS site and consolidating them for reporting. 

It requires an edge driver to run selenium for the automated data pull. 

Edge was the only one that worked consistently. Chrome has issues losing the curser when selecting multiple years and 
Firefox had a download check prompt that I could not get rid of.
